IMPORTANT - READ THROUGH: About H2 Database
----------------------------------------------
#### Please read through.

In the next video, we are going to create our object and test whether or not the table gets created in the H2 database. I have received an unexpected number of reports that after opening the H2 database console, the table is not present.

#### I want to clarify the following pointers:


1. I want to remind you, that  previous basic experience with the Spring Framework is expected for this course. This was clearly discussed in the "WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY: Requirements, IDEs, Support"  video (Do not skip this video)

https://www.udemy.com/full-stack-project-spring-boot-20-react-redux/learn/v4/t/lecture/11792132/?instructorPreviewMode=student_v4

2. You need to make sure that you have the correct folder structure for your Spring Boot project

3. Check the Q&A in this lecture, read through, and try a different JDBC
URL if the one out of the box doesn't work for you

4. Make sure that you have the right @Entity import (Please, check your code against mine)

Finally, since you have previous experience, do not get hung up on the H2 database not working (which should not be the case) just set up MySQL or any other DB that you are already comfortable with. Later in the course we will set up MySQL anyway.
